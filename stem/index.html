									<h5>Engineering Design and Presentation (9-12)</h5>
									<p>Involved in many engineering ventures that students can partake. Assignments are given and are
										shared with the
										class or, on most occasions, just shared with the teacher. Give students the opportunity to blossom
										interest
										in engineering as a career path.</p>
									<h5>Engineering Design and Problem Solving (Bioscience)</h5>
									<p>In Engineering Design and Problem Solving for the Biosciences, students explore bioscience
										engineering using
										their math, science, and biotechnology backgrounds to solve engineering problems in the life science
										field.
										Students engaged in experiments and hands-on activities at least 40% of the time.</p>
									<h5>Engineering Design and Problem Solving (Digital Electronics)</h5>
									<p>In Engineering Design and Problem Solving for Digital Electronics, students apply knowledge from
										previous mathematics,
										science, and engineering courses to develop problem-solving skills using Digital Electronics.
										Students engage
										in skill development and hands-on activities at least 40% of the time. Special emphasis is placed on
										current
										trends in technology including robotics and circuit simulation.</p>
									<h5>Engineering Mathematics</h5>
									<p>Engineering Mathematics is a course where students solve and model robotic design problems.
										Students use a variety
										of mathematical methods and models to represent and analyze problems involving data acquisition,
										spatial applications,
										electrical measurement, manufacturing processes, and materials engineering.</p>
									<h5>Robotics</h5>
									<p>In Robotics, students build a knowledge base for working with computer-controlled devices. Students
										use the engineering
										design process to create prototypes, test, analyze, and improve designs. The focus is on basic robot
